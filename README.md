# Xilinx FPGA Block RAM
Xilinx ISE provides coding examples template to generate Block RAMs. It normally requires changing variable names in the template code every time one wants to use BRAMs. 
This code is a parametrized wrapper based on template code that allows to generate BRAM of any size and if required provide initialization file for BRAM. 
Test bench tests the BRAM with some simple sequential reads and writes.


Following video explains how the code was created and how to use it
